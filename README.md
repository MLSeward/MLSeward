- ðŸ‘‹Hi, Iâ€™m Monise.
  
- Math Teacher :abacus: | Spreadsheet Maker :ledger:| Data Enthusiast | All-around Problem Solver :bulb: 

- ðŸ‘€ I started learning about SQL and Data Visualization last Summer (2023) through a CoRise (now Uplimit) Bootcamp. Iâ€™m interested in learning more during the next few months to better prepare for my first 'official' Data Analyst role. My goal is to join a dynamic Data team in an organization that can recognize people who are eager to learn, grow, and contribute!
