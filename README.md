- 👋Hi, I’m Monise.
  
- Math Teacher :abacus: | Spreadsheet Maker :ledger:| Data Enthusiast | All-around Problem Solver :bulb: 

- 👀 I started learning about SQL and Data Visualization last Summer (2023) through a CoRise (now Uplimit) Bootcamp. I’m interested in learning more during the next few months to better prepare for my first 'official' Data Analyst role. My goal is to join a dynamic Data team in an organization that can recognize people who are eager to learn, grow, and contribute!

**My 1st SQL Projects through CoRise:**

    Week #2: [AirBnB Sydney](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Ym0yOakmL1qif5aHdrOEgicI3KKGKn6N?usp=sharing).
