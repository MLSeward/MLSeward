- ðŸ‘‹Hi, Iâ€™m Monise.
  
- Math Teacher :abacus: | Spreadsheet Maker :ledger:| Data Enthusiast | All-around Problem Solver :bulb: 

- ðŸ‘€ I started learning about SQL and Data Visualization last Summer (2023) through an Uplimit Bootcamp. Iâ€™m interested in continuing my learning to better prepare for my first 'official' Data Analyst role.

I have also been juggling a full-time job, part-time job, and coaching Volleyball for 5 months. BTW: The 7th grade team I coached won the championship for our region! 

As a result of managing those responsibilities, I have an ever-growing 'To Learn' list and I am making use of every extra minute to practice, create projects, and keep my Git updated. I am certain that once I land a full-time role working with data, I will be able to quickly build upon those skills while contributing to a team/department.

My goal is to join a dynamic organization that will recognize that I am eager to learn, grow, and contribute.
